# 📊 Data Studies

This repository is dedicated to my **studies and practice in Data Analysis**.

Here I share projects, exercises, and analyses developed during my learning journey, focusing on transforming data into insights and improving my analytical skills.

The content includes practical applications using tools commonly used in the data field, such as **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, applied to real or simulated datasets.

This repository is continuously updated as I progress in my studies and develop new projects.
